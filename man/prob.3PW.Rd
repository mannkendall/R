\title{Applies the 3PW method
Estimate the probability of the MK test with the 3PW method. To have the maximal certainty, P is taken as the maximum of P.PW and P.TFPW.Y. Estimate the statistical significance of the MK test as a function of the given confidence level alpha.mk}
\usage{
prob.3PW(P.PW, P.TFPW.Y, alpha.mk)
}
\arguments{
\item{P.PW}{probability computed from the PW prewhitened dataset}

\item{P.TFPW.Y}{probability computed from the TFPW_Y prewhitened dataset}

\item{alpha.mk}{confidence level in percentage for the MK test.}
}
\value{
P probability of the MK test according to the 3PW method

ss statistical significance of the MK test (given the alpha.mk)
}
